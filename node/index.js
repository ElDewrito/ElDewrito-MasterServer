  /announce - used by game servers to announce their server to this master server
  GET parameters:
  - port (int) - port number of the JSON info server
  - shutdown (bool) - specified if the server is shutting down, to let the master know to remove it

  This route connects to $REMOTE_ADDR:$PORT and makes sure the JSON info server is accessible
  then checks if the "port" (game port number) specified in the JSON is accessible
  If they're both accessible then it adds the server to the Redis database (or updates the lastUpdate time if it already exists)

  If shutdown is specified it'll remove the $REMOTE_ADDR:$PORT entry from Redis.

  Game servers should keep contacting the /announce route every two minutes or so to make sure its entry doesn't expire.

/*
  /stats - used by clients after game ends to record their stats
  GET parameters:
  - none
  
  POST data: JSON in the format:
  {
    "statsVersion": 1,
    "stats": "{\"gameId\": 122334455, \"kills\": 21, \"deaths\": 0, \"assists\": 1, \"medals\": [\"doublekill\", \"triplekill\", \"overkill\", \"unfreakingbelieveable\"]",
    "publicKey": "base64 encoded public key",
    "signature": "base64 encoded signature"
  }
  
  When received by the master, the master should first make sure the stats signature is valid for that public key.
  Once it's been verified the master can trust that the stats belong to that public key, and the public key itself can be used as an identifier for the user.
  To make the identifier shorter a hash should be made of the public key (the actual public key data sent by the client unmodified)
  In ElDewrito we use a SHA256 hash of this key and copy the first 8 bytes of it to serve as the user ID, stats services should use the full hash and allow users to look up players from partial hashes.
  
  I chose this method for stats recording for a number of reasons:
  - We can trust that these stats are from that user, no other user can pretend to be another one unless they steal the private key (security is main priority for a stats system IMO)
  
  - This system is decentralized, stats can be sent to multiple master servers at once, none of them needing to know the users secret (eg. needing to hold a users login/password, or in this case the private key)
  
  - Everything sent by the client (pubkey, signature, stats data) could be shown publicly, with no risk to the user, allowing them to verify their stats haven't been tampered with by the server operator or others
  
  - Future-proof: if every stats server suddenly closed others can easily start new servers
    stats server owners could even make their database public if they decide to shut down or something, with no security risk by doing so
    others can import that database and users will be able to update their stats with the same key they used before.
  
  - Identifiers based on the public key could be tied with a login system easily (could maybe implement something ingame so that private key holders have to confirm they want a login tied to it though)
  
  - As players stats are tied to this public key, and their in-game identifier is tied to it too, banning players based on it could be possible (a la steam IDs)
   (although they can easily change it they would lose their stats too, hacking to make stats look better is one of the main reasons people hack afaik)
  
  Although it does have it's drawbacks:
  - To sync stats between machines people would have to copy their private key over, some might not be able to do this, but if they can't copy a file it's a wonder that they managed to install ED at all..
  
  - If you lose your private key you have no chance of recovering it, stopping you from ever updating your stats again (arrangements can probably be made with stats server owners to move stats to a new key though)
  
  - Since stats recording is done by the client it wouldn't take much effort to report fake stats for themselves
    (It'd take a bit more effort but server-side stats could also have fake stats reported too, but having server-side stats means people can mess with other peoples stats too if they know the user id)
    I figured if people are going to cheat they will, but with this system there's no way they can mess around with other peoples stats, which is more of a priority than fudging with your own
